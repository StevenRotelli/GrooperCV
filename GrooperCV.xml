            <remarks>
            Welcome to Grooper Scripting!  Here is some quick information for beginners:
            
            1) Member variables of this class will stay intact between Initialize() and Uninitialize().
            2) Please note that compiling this script from Visual Studio will not add/update the ObjectLibrary DLL in Grooper.  To add/update 
               this DLL in Grooper and make the functionality in this project visible to Grooper, the Compile button must be 
               used from the Script tab of the Grooper node in the Grooper Web Client.
            3) Object Library scripts can be used to customize the way that Grooper works.  This can be done by extending a 
               Grooper class through inheritance or by creating methods that can be called from within Grooper.
            4) Data Model and Batch Process Scripts operate primarily by responding to events on the object to which they are
               attached.  Viewing a list of events your script can handle in Visual Studio: select ObjectLibrary from the objects dropdown 
               above, and then view the right-most dropdown for a list of events.
            5) You can debug with the GrooperSDK.  Find the GrooperSDK in Visual Studio by going to Extensions..Manage Extensions..Online and searching for 'Grooper'.  
               In addition to debugging, the GrooperSDK exposes commands such as Save, Save and Compile, and Get Latest.
            6) More information can be found using Grooper Help (open Grooper and click F1) or the Grooper Wiki: https://wiki.grooper.com/.
